# Pumpkin Dog's Graveyard Adventure
This game was inspired by my all-time favourite game,  [Monster Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Bash).

You can download the game file from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tyk60b35clan5b1/AABZcjetMHWPuCBCYJlJx4kja?dl=0). Download the whole folder and don't move the .exe file from the folder - it needs to remain in the same folder with all the other files in order to work.

# How to play
* Press any key to continue.
* Press ESC to quit.
* Move left and right with the arrow keys.
* Jump with the space bar.
* Collect all the pumpkins!
* Avoid the ghosts: you lose a point every time you hit one.
* Collect all the pumpkins in under 50 seconds to get a time bonus!
