# Pumpkin Dog's Graveyard Adventure

*Pumpkin Dog's Graveyard Adventure* is a 2D platformer game where your goal is to collect all the pumpkins at the graveyard while avoiding the ghosts. It was inspired by my all-time favourite game,  [Monster Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Bash).

You can download the game from [Itch](https://hetabjorklund.itch.io/pumpkin-dog). Start the game by opening the *Pumpkin Dog's Graveyard Adventure.exe* file. Don't move the .exe file from the folder - there are hidden files included in the folder that are required for the .exe file to work.

# How to play
* Press any key to continue on to the game or press ESC to quit.
* Move left and right with the arrow keys, jump with the space bar.
* Collect all the pumpkins! You get one point from each pumpkin.
* Avoid the ghosts: you lose a point every time you hit one.
* If you collect all the pumpkins in under 50 seconds, you get a time bonus!
